/**
 * Builds a compile-time guard that a tuple lists every member of `Union`
 * exactly once — no missing members, no extras and no duplicates. It is meant
 * to keep a runtime list in sync with a union type: whenever the union changes,
 * the tuple stops type-checking until it is updated to match.
 *
 * Because TypeScript cannot infer one type argument while another is given
 * explicitly, the union is passed to the outer call and the tuple is inferred
 * by the returned function. At runtime the returned function is the identity
 * function — all of the work happens in the type system. An invalid tuple fails
 * to type-check with a message that names the missing, extra or duplicated
 * members (see {@link AllUnionMembers}).
 *
 * By default the result is widened to a mutable tuple; pass `{readonly: true}`
 * as the second type argument to preserve the `readonly` tuple type instead.
 * @returns A function that accepts the tuple and returns it unchanged, typed as
 * the tuple of `Union`'s members (mutable by default, `readonly` on request).
 * @example
 * type Fruit = 'apple' | 'banana' | 'cherry';
 *
 * // OK — lists every member exactly once
 * const fruits = allUnionMembers<Fruit>()(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']);
 * // type: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
 * @example
 * // Error — "...is missing these union members": "cherry"
 * allUnionMembers<Fruit>()(['apple', 'banana']);
 * @example
 * // Error — 'apple' is duplicated
 * allUnionMembers<Fruit>()(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple']);
 * @example
 * // Error — 'date' is not a member of `Fruit`
 * allUnionMembers<Fruit>()(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']);
 * @example
 * // Keep the tuple `readonly`
 * const readonlyFruits = allUnionMembers<Fruit, {readonly: true}>()([
 *   'apple',
 *   'banana',
 *   'cherry',
 * ]);
 * // type: readonly ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
