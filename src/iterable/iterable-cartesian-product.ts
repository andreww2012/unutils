/**
 * Lazily yields every tuple made by picking one element from each iterable
 * (the Cartesian product), in lexicographic order: the last iterable changes
 * fastest. Yields a single empty tuple when no iterables are passed, and
 * nothing when any of them is empty.
 *
 * Every iterable except the first one is read into an array when iteration
 * starts, as it is traversed many times. The first one is read lazily, so it
 * may be infinite.
 *
 * The lazy counterpart of `array/cartesianProduct`.
 * @param iterables - The iterables to combine.
 * @returns A lazy iterator over the tuples of the product.
 * @example
 * [...iterableCartesianProduct([1, 2], ['a', 'b'])];
 * // [[1, 'a'], [1, 'b'], [2, 'a'], [2, 'b']]
