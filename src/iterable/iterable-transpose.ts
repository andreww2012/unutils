/**
 * Lazily pairs up the elements at the same positions of several iterables:
 * the `n`-th tuple holds the `n`-th element of every iterable (a "zip").
 * Iteration stops as soon as the **shortest** iterable ends, so infinite
 * iterables are fine as long as one of them is finite. Every iterator is
 * closed when iteration ends.
 *
 * The lazy counterpart of `array/arrayTranspose`, which pads to the longest
 * array instead.
 * @param iterables - The iterables to pair up.
 * @returns A lazy iterator over tuples of the elements at matching positions.
 * @example
 * [...iterableTranspose([[1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b']])];
 * // [[1, 'a'], [2, 'b']]
 * @example
 * // Number the elements of a set
 * [...iterableTranspose([iterableRange(1, Infinity), new Set(['x', 'y'])])];
 * // [[1, 'x'], [2, 'y']]
