import {objectUpdate as objectUpdateBase} from 'ts-extras';

/**
 * Applies a type-checked partial update to `target` in place, **mutating** and
 * returning it. The `source` is constrained to the target's existing writable
 * keys, so the compiler rejects unknown keys, mismatched value types, and
 * `readonly` keys — even when `source` is a pre-typed variable rather than an
 * object literal.
 *
 * Unlike `objectAssign`, this never adds keys or changes their types; it only
 * overwrites existing writable ones, which is what makes it safe for partial
 * updates. Union-typed targets are unsupported — narrow to a single variant
 * first — and `source` must expose at least one known key.
 * @param target - The object to update in place.
 * @param source - A partial of `target` covering only its existing writable keys.
 * @returns The mutated `target`.
 * @example
 * const user = {name: 'Ada', age: 41};
 * objectUpdate(user, {age: 42});
 * // user is now {name: 'Ada', age: 42}
 * @example
 * // Rejected at compile time
 * objectUpdate(user, {email: 'ada@example.com'}); // unknown key
 * objectUpdate(user, {age: '42'}); // wrong value type
