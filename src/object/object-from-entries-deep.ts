import {setByPath} from './set-by-path.ts';

/**
 * Builds an object from an iterable of `[path, value]` entries — the deep-path
 * counterpart of `Object.fromEntries`. Each key is interpreted as a deep path
 * (a dot/bracket string like `'a.b[0].c'`, a single key, or an array of
 * segments), so intermediate objects and arrays are created as needed. Numeric
 * segments create arrays; everything else creates plain objects.
 *
 * Entries are applied in order; a later entry writing to the same path
 * overwrites an earlier one. Delegates the per-path writes to `setByPath`.
 * @param entries - An iterable of `[path, value]` pairs.
 * @returns A new object assembled from the entries.
 * @example
 * // Deep paths build nested objects and arrays
 * objectFromEntriesDeep([
 *   ['a.b[0].c', 1],
 *   ['a.b[1].d', 2],
 * ]);
 * // {a: {b: [{c: 1}, {d: 2}]}}
 * @example
 * // Flat keys behave like Object.fromEntries
 * objectFromEntriesDeep([
 *   ['x', 1],
 *   ['y', 2],
 * ]);
 * // {x: 1, y: 2}
