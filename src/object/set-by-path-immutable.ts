/**
 * Returns a **new** object equal to `object` but with the value at the given
 * deep `path` replaced by `value` — without mutating the input. This is the
 * immutable, statically-typed counterpart to `setByPath`: `path` must be an
 * array of keys that **already exists** in the object's type (invalid paths are
 * a compile error), and `value` must match the type at that path.
 *
 * Because the path must already exist, this does not build missing containers —
 * use the mutable `setByPath` for dynamic, build-from-scratch writes.
 * @param object - The source object. Not mutated.
 * @param path - An array of keys identifying an existing location, e.g. `['a', 'b']`.
 * @param value - The replacement value; must match the type currently at `path`.
 * @returns A new object with the value at `path` replaced.
 * @example
 * // Replace a nested value immutably
 * setByPathImmutable({a: {b: 1}}, ['a', 'b'], 2);
 * // {a: {b: 2}} — the input is unchanged
 * @example
 * // The value type is checked against the path
 * setByPathImmutable({user: {age: 30}}, ['user', 'age'], 31);
 * // {user: {age: 31}}
