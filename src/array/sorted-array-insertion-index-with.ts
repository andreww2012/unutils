import {sortedIndexWith} from 'remeda';

/**
 * Finds an insertion index into an already-sorted `sortedArray` using a binary
 * search driven by a `predicate`. The predicate must return `true` for every
 * element that should come *before* the insertion point and `false` from there
 * on (i.e. it must be monotonic over the sorted array); the returned index is
 * the first position at which it becomes `false`, in the range
 * `0..sortedArray.length`.
 *
 * This is the most general member of the `sortedArrayInsertionIndex*` family:
 * unlike {@link sortedArrayInsertionIndex} it takes no search value and is not
 * limited to `number`/`string` keys, so it can locate a boundary for any
 * comparable condition. The runtime is delegated to remeda's `sortedIndexWith`.
 * @param sortedArray - The already-sorted array to search. Not mutated.
 * @param predicate - Returns `true` for elements before the insertion point. Receives the value, its index, and the array.
 * @returns The first index at which `predicate` returns `false`, in `0..sortedArray.length`.
 * @example
 * // First index whose value is not less than 2
 * sortedArrayInsertionIndexWith([1, 2, 2, 3], (value) => value < 2);
 * // 1
 * @example
 * // Boundary by a derived key
 * sortedArrayInsertionIndexWith(
 *   [{age: 10}, {age: 20}, {age: 30}],
 *   (item) => item.age < 25,
 * );
 * // 2
