 * Strict counterpart of `./query-selector-typed.global.ts`: same global augmentation, except a
 * malformed selector resolves to `never` instead of falling back to `Element`, so a typo
 * fails to compile rather than surfacing as a runtime throw.
 *
 * Mutually exclusive with `unutils/dom/query-selector-typed.global`: both augment the same
 * members, so importing both merges two conflicting sets of overloads
