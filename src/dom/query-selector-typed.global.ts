 * Side-effect-only module: importing it augments the DOM lookup methods globally so
 * that *every* call site infers its element type from the selector, with no wrappers
 * and no call-site changes. Deliberately not re-exported from the group barrel — that
 * would force the augmentation on everyone importing `unutils/dom`.
 *
 * Mutually exclusive with `unutils/dom/query-selector-typed-strict.global`: both augment the
 * same members, so importing both merges two conflicting sets of overloads
