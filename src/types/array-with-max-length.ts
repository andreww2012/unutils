/**
 * Every shape `TArray` can take once it is known to hold no more than `TMaxLength` elements: a union of tuples of length `0` through `TMaxLength` that keeps the element type of each position.
 * Shapes `TArray` can never actually take are dropped, so an input whose required elements alone already exceed `TMaxLength` resolves to `never`.
 * `readonly` is carried over to every member of the union.
 * A non-literal `TMaxLength` constrains nothing and yields `TArray` unchanged.
 * @example
 * type A = ArrayWithMaxLength<number[], 2>;
 * //=> [] | [number] | [number, number]
 * @example
 * // Positions keep their own types, and impossible lengths are dropped
 * type B = ArrayWithMaxLength<[string, ...number[]], 2>;
 * //=> [string] | [string, number]
 * @example
 * // Three elements can never fit into two
 * type C = ArrayWithMaxLength<[string, number, boolean], 2>;
 * //=> never

 * Both recursive branches are bare calls so TypeScript's tail-call elimination applies; building the union inside either branch instead would cap `TMaxLength` at ~47.
