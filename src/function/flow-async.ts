import {flowAsync as esFlowAsync} from 'es-toolkit/fp';

/**
 * Async counterpart of `flow`: composes a list of functions into a single
 * function that returns a promise. Each function receives the **awaited**
 * result of the previous one, so sync and async functions can be mixed
 * freely. By default the first function in the list receives the call
 * arguments; with `isFromRight = true`, the last function in the list is
 * invoked first.
 * @param functions - The functions to compose. Must contain at least one
 * function; the first one may accept any signature, every following one is
 * called with a single argument (the previous awaited return value).
 * @param isFromRight - When `true`, runs the list right-to-left (compose).
 * Defaults to `false` (pipe).
 * @returns A function that, when invoked, threads its input through the
 * composed list and resolves to the final awaited result.
 * @example
 * // Pipe: input flows left-to-right, awaiting every step
 * const loadUserName = flowAsync([
 *   (id: number) => fetch(`/api/users/${id}`),
 *   (response: Response) => response.json(),
 *   (user: {name: string}) => user.name,
 * ]);
 * await loadUserName(1);
 * // 'Alice'
 * @example
 * // Compose: input flows right-to-left
 * const composed = flowAsync(
 *   [(value: number) => `result: ${value}`, async (value: number) => value * 2],
 *   true,
 * );
 * await composed(3);
 * // 'result: 6'
