/**
 * Returns the value stored under `key`, first inserting the result of `computeDefaultValue` when
 * the key is not present.
 *
 * The lazy counterpart of `mapGetOrInsert`: `computeDefaultValue` runs only on a miss, so it suits
 * defaults that are expensive to build, must not be shared between keys, or have side effects.
 * An already present value is never overwritten, and a stored `undefined` counts as present.
 * @param map - The map to read from. Mutated only when `key` is not present.
 * @param key - The key to look up.
 * @param computeDefaultValue - Produces the value to insert. Called with `key`, and only when `key` is not present.
 * @returns The value already stored under `key`, or the computed value when it has just been inserted.
 * @example
 * // Grouping entries by key — every miss gets its own array
 * const entriesByPackageId = new Map<string, Entry[]>();
 * mapGetOrInsertComputed(entriesByPackageId, packageId, () => []).push(newEntry);
 * @example
 * // The looked-up key is passed to the factory
 * const messagesByChannel = new Map<string, string[]>();
 * mapGetOrInsertComputed(messagesByChannel, 'general', (channel) => [`joined ${channel}`]);
 * // ['joined general']
 * @example
 * // Nothing is computed for a key that is already there
 * mapGetOrInsertComputed(new Map([['alice', 10]]), 'alice', () => expensiveDefault());
 * // 10, `expensiveDefault` never runs
