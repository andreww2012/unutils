/**
 * Like `structuredStringify`, but also accepts promises anywhere inside the
 * value: each one is awaited, and the value it resolves to is serialized in its
 * place. `structuredParse` therefore revives the resolved values, not promises.
 *
 * Unlike `jsonStringifyAsync`, it does **not** yield to the event loop while
 * serializing — it is asynchronous only because of the promises it awaits.
 * @param value - The value to serialize. May contain promises, rich types and circular references.
 * @param reducers - Optional map, keyed by name, of functions that turn a
 * non-standard value into a serializable intermediate form (paired with a
 * reviver of the same name in `structuredParse`).
 * @param options - Optional settings.
 * @param options.operations - Overrides for how values are inspected; see `StructuredStringifyOperations`.
 * @returns A promise resolving to the serialized string — read it back only with `structuredParse`.
 * @throws {StructuredStringifyError} When the value contains something that
 * cannot be serialized. A rejected promise inside the value rejects the result
 * with its reason.
 * @example
 * // Await promises nested inside the value
 * const serialized = await structuredStringifyAsync({user: fetchUser(), posts: [fetchPost(1)]});
 * structuredParse(serialized);
 * // {user: {...}, posts: [{...}]}
